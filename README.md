# PubWriter

[PubWriter](https://pubwriter.com) leverages desktop [Sync](https://pubwriter.com/sync), Markdown, Bootstrap, custom CSS, and javascript to give you a powerful static website generator to build one-of-kind websites that can be adapted for almost any purpose. It's introduces an effortless 'save-to-publish' approach where everything you create is automatically backed up while simultaneously published to your website. If you're frustrated with the limitations of the platform you are currently on. It is similar to frameworks like Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll - yet doesn't require nearly the depth of coder knowledge.

To get the most from PubWriter, you should have an understanding of [Markdown](https://pubwriter.com/markdown) (which you can learn very quickly), a plain text editor (I recommend VSC), and a free [Sync account](https://pubwriter.com/sync). The advantage of PubWriter over other static website generators is our 'save-to-publish' technology. To create or edit a page, you simply save it locally in your own sync folder. Within 30 seconds, the page you save will be published to your website.

This repo is also used for site owners store image files to be accessed via their PubWriter sites.

We designed PubWriter 'mobile-first' in mind because over 50% of all web traffic is now via smart phones. PubWriter sites are fast, secure, and extremely easy to update (no login required!). We often hit all greens on the Google lighthouse tests which help ensure your site ranks high on search engines:
